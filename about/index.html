    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Since arriving at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, my intellectual curiosity has only grown while I pursue a career in the intersection between business and technology, likely some form of analytics. These objectives encourage me to challenge myself inside and outside the classroom, constantly being one percent better than I was yesterday.</p>
<p>I am now a junior - typing that made me feel old - Actuarial Science major with minors in Mathematics, Statistics, and Business Analytics. I am a student in the 6th cohort of the Nebraska Business Honors Academy: an organization focused on an academically rigorous curriculum, leadership, and community involvement.</p>
<p>I am an incoming Government Human Services Consulting Actuarial Analyst Intern at Mercer, looking to develop further upon my current communication and technical skills.</p>
<p>Besides my formal education, I currently volunteer within the Huskers Athletics Sports Analytics department. This opportunity allows me to collect and analyze performance data to improve the performance of the Universityâ€™s teams. Additionally, I am apart of a startup team called Heyday, composed of UNL students looking to provide Gen Z with better money management opportunities.</p>
<p>I interned at Lincoln Financial Group during the 2020 summer, working as an reserve production intern within their valuation department, focusing on revamping the company&rsquo;s $100 million IBNR model. I&rsquo;ve been a research assistant within the College of Business, working on a project analyzing how NCAA football coaching turnover affects player performance. I&rsquo;ve participated in multiple case competitions while at UNL - 2020 UNL Actuarial Science Competition (2nd), 2020 Travelers Case Competition (2nd), Arbor Day Foundation Innovation Challenge (1st), and State Farm Business with Integrity Case Competition (1st).</p>
